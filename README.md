# Herdr Bark Notify

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) · **English**

Send a Bark notification to your iPhone when a Herdr agent finishes work (`done`) or needs input (`blocked`). Each notification identifies the agent, workspace and pane, so multiple Claude Code or Codex sessions remain distinguishable.

This is an event-driven Herdr plugin: no polling, daemon, npm dependencies or build step. Configure your Bark endpoint once. Herdr launches the script for matching events.

## Requirements

- **Herdr 0.9.0 or newer.** The manifest deliberately requires the version whose event contract was checked during development.
- **Node.js 22 or newer**, available as `node` in the Herdr **server's** `PATH`.
- Bark installed on your iPhone, notifications allowed, and a valid device push key.
- Network access from the machine running Herdr to `api.day.app` or your self-hosted Bark server.

The implementation uses portable Node APIs and declares macOS, Linux and Windows support. Local verification was performed on macOS with Node 24 and Herdr 0.9.0; the repository includes a CI matrix for Node 22/24 on all three operating systems. A CI definition is not evidence that those remote jobs have already run.

## Quick start: local checkout

Run these commands from this repository's root directory. No `npm install` is required.

```sh
node --version
herdr --version
herdr plugin link .
herdr plugin list --plugin herdr.bark-notify
herdr plugin config-dir herdr.bark-notify
```

The plugin ID is **`herdr.bark-notify`**. Use this ID everywhere; `example.bark-notify` in the earlier discussion was a placeholder.

### macOS / Linux

```sh
bark_config_dir="$(herdr plugin config-dir herdr.bark-notify)"
node notify.mjs init --config "$bark_config_dir/config.json" --locale en
```

Open the resulting `config.json` in your editor and replace `YOUR_BARK_KEY` with the key shown in the Bark app:

```json
{
  "bark_url": "https://api.day.app/YOUR_BARK_KEY",
  "locale": "en"
}
```

`init` creates the directory if needed, uses `0600` permissions for the new file on Unix, and refuses to overwrite an existing file. For an existing config, edit it directly. Do not put your actual key in the source checkout.

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$barkConfigDir = (herdr plugin config-dir herdr.bark-notify).Trim()
$barkConfigFile = Join-Path $barkConfigDir 'config.json'
node .\notify.mjs init --config $barkConfigFile --locale en
notepad $barkConfigFile
```

The same JSON configuration applies. Windows file access is controlled by the directory's ACLs; Unix permission bits do not establish a private Windows ACL.

### Verify configuration and delivery

From the repository directory, these commands also work without an active Herdr session:

```sh
node notify.mjs check --config "$bark_config_dir/config.json"
node notify.mjs preview --config "$bark_config_dir/config.json"
node notify.mjs test --status done --config "$bark_config_dir/config.json"
node notify.mjs test --status blocked --config "$bark_config_dir/config.json"
```

In PowerShell, replace `"$bark_config_dir/config.json"` with `$barkConfigFile`.

- `check` validates configuration and the endpoint's presence; it makes **no network request**.
- `preview` prints notification JSON with sample data; it makes **no network request** and omits the endpoint and device key.
- `test` sends a real notification prefixed with `[TEST / 测试]`. It deliberately bypasses `enabled` and status switches so connectivity can be tested while notifications are disabled.

Inside a running Herdr session, the equivalent registered actions are:

```sh
herdr plugin action invoke herdr.bark-notify.check
herdr plugin action invoke herdr.bark-notify.preview
herdr plugin action invoke herdr.bark-notify.test-done
herdr plugin action invoke herdr.bark-notify.test-blocked
herdr plugin log list --plugin herdr.bark-notify
```

Action execution may be asynchronous. Inspect the plugin command log for script output and exit status. Preview and test actions use synthetic sample context, rather than claiming to report an actual task completion.

Now run a normal agent task inside Herdr. When Herdr reports `done` or `blocked`, the plugin automatically sends a notification. It does not infer completion from a shell process exit or read terminal output. Herdr's agent detection and integrations must be functioning for these events to exist.

## Installing from GitHub

Once this repository has been published to GitHub, other users can install it with:

```sh
herdr plugin install OWNER/herdr-bark-notify
herdr plugin config-dir herdr.bark-notify
```

`OWNER` is a placeholder, not an already published repository. Create `config.json` in the printed directory using the minimal JSON above, then use the registered `check` and test actions. The GitHub installation does not require `npm install` or a build command.

Herdr plugin registration and enable state are shared across the current user's sessions. Linking is supported while no server is running. For a running server, registration changes apply without restarting it. If Node was installed after the server started, its inherited `PATH` may still need to be refreshed.

## Default square avatars

Version 1.1.0 automatically attaches LobeHub square avatars for **19 of the 23 Herdr 0.9.0 agent kinds**, including corresponding brand avatars where a dedicated CLI avatar is unavailable. OMP, Droid, Maki and Muse retain Bark’s default icon. No extra configuration is required. See the [complete coverage table, sources and overrides](docs/AVATARS.md).

To disable default avatars, set `"notification": { "icon": null }`. Your existing custom `icon` takes precedence. The images are 640×640 PNG logos from LobeHub. They differ from the WebP Avatar package’s background styling; PNG is used because the WebP avatars failed device testing. The final notification mask is controlled by iOS.

## Configuration reference

Only the Bark endpoint is required. The default notification language is **`zh-CN`**; set `"locale": "en"` for English. See [config.example.json](config.example.json) for an extended, copyable example.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bark_url` | Required for sending | Full key endpoint, e.g. `https://api.day.app/KEY`, or a `/push` endpoint with `device_key`. |
| `device_key` | Omitted | Required for `/push`; rejected for a key-in-path endpoint. |
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch for automatic notifications. |
| `locale` | `"zh-CN"` | `"zh-CN"` or `"en"`; controls default status labels and body text. |
| `timeout_ms` | `5000` | Per-attempt deadline, including reading the response body. Integer, 100–10000. |
| `retries` | `1` | Additional attempts after transient errors. Integer, 0–2. |
| `notification` | Built-in templates | Global Bark fields and templates. |
| `statuses` | Both enabled | `done` and `blocked` settings, each with optional `enabled` and `notification`. |
| `agents` | Built-in names | Settings keyed by the exact event `data.agent` value. Each allows `name`, `notification`, `statuses`. |

Unknown options, unsupported template variables and invalid types are errors rather than silently ignored settings. JSON must not contain comments or trailing commas. UTF-8 BOMs, such as those produced by some Windows editors, are accepted.

### Notification fields

| Field | Default / accepted values |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | `{emoji} {agent} · {status_label}` |
| `subtitle` | `{workspace} / {pane}` |
| `body` | `{message}\nAgent: {agent_id}\nPane: {pane_id}`; rendered body must contain visible text. |
| `group` | `herdr-{agent_id}`; separates agents in Bark. |
| `sound` | Omitted, letting Bark use its default. Set a Bark sound name, e.g. `bell`, `minuet`, `calypso`, `alarm`. |
| `icon` | Defaults to the matching LobeHub square avatar when available. Override with a URL or disable with `null`. |
| `url` | Optional URL opened when the notification is tapped. No Herdr mobile deep link is assumed. |
| `level` | Optional: `active`, `passive`, `timeSensitive`, `critical`. Availability depends on Bark and iOS permissions. |
| `badge` | Optional integer, 0–99999. |
| `isArchive` | Optional `0` or `1`. Omitted means Bark app settings decide. |
| `copy` | Optional text to copy from the notification. |

String fields support the variables below, except `level`, which accepts only its listed values. Use `null` or `""` to remove an inherited optional field. Do not remove or empty `body`. This plugin intentionally exposes a subset of Bark's API; arbitrary extra JSON fields are not forwarded.

### Template variables

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `{agent}` | Configured name → event `display_agent` → built-in friendly name → raw agent ID → `Agent`. |
| `{agent_id}` | Raw agent identifier; `unknown` when unavailable. |
| `{display_agent}` | Event's display label, or empty. |
| `{status}` | `done` or `blocked`. |
| `{status_label}` | `完成` / `需要处理`, or `Done` / `Needs attention`. |
| `{emoji}` | `✓` or `⚠`. |
| `{message}` | Localized default status sentence. |
| `{workspace}` | Event workspace label if present → matching context label → workspace ID → localized fallback. |
| `{workspace_id}` | Event workspace ID, with Herdr environment fallback. |
| `{pane}` | Event `title` / `pane_title` → matching pane label, title or terminal title from Herdr → pane ID → localized fallback. |
| `{pane_id}` | Event pane ID, with Herdr environment fallback. |
| `{tab}` / `{tab_id}` | Event fields or matching focused-pane context; empty when unavailable. |

Templates use literal replacement, not executable expressions. Substitution happens once: text inside an agent or pane name is never evaluated as another template. Each `title`, `subtitle` and `group` is capped at 240 UTF-8 bytes; `body` is capped at 1600 bytes with an ellipsis. The rendered notification fields must fit within 3000 bytes of JSON to leave room for APNs overhead. This is a conservative plugin limit, not a guarantee about every server's final APNs envelope.

Workspace context is used only when its workspace ID matches the event. Focused-agent and tab context is used only when its pane ID matches. If information is missing, IDs are shown rather than guessing from another focused pane. If an automatic event has no title, the plugin queries only that pane using `HERDR_BIN_PATH pane get <event-pane-id>`, with a one-second deadline and matching-ID checks. Failure falls back to the ID. Pane names are supplied by Herdr; the plugin does not summarize or invent task titles.

### Agent and status customization

Notification fields merge in this order, with later settings overriding earlier ones:

1. Built-in defaults.
2. Global `notification`.
3. `statuses.<status>.notification`.
4. `agents.<agent_id>.notification`.
5. `agents.<agent_id>.statuses.<status>.notification`.

Status enable switches use the agent-specific value first, then the global status value, then `true`. The top-level `enabled: false` always blocks automatic notifications.

For example, disable completion notifications globally, keep Codex completions, and use a distinct alarm for blocked Codex tasks:

```json
{
  "bark_url": "https://api.day.app/YOUR_BARK_KEY",
  "locale": "en",
  "notification": { "group": "herdr-{workspace_id}-{agent_id}" },
  "statuses": { "done": { "enabled": false } },
  "agents": {
    "codex": {
      "name": "Codex",
      "notification": { "sound": "bell" },
      "statuses": {
        "done": { "enabled": true },
        "blocked": { "notification": { "sound": "alarm" } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Agent keys are exact and case-sensitive. Built-in display names cover all 23 Herdr 0.9.0 kinds; [avatar/name aliases](docs/AVATARS.md) do **not** merge configuration entries. Use the raw `Agent:` value from your notification when choosing an `agents` key. To preserve custom Herdr `display_agent` labels, omit `agents.<id>.name`.

### Self-hosted Bark and environment variables

```json
{
  "bark_url": "https://bark.example.com/push",
  "device_key": "YOUR_BARK_KEY",
  "locale": "en"
}
```

Reverse-proxy path prefixes are supported, for example `https://example.com/bark/push`. Use the final endpoint, not a URL that redirects. Key-in-path URLs must stop at the key: do not paste Bark's sample `/KEY/title/body` URL. Query strings, URL userinfo and fragments are rejected; put notification options in `notification` instead. HTTPS is recommended. HTTP is allowed for self-hosted or local development, but transmits the key and notification without TLS.

`BARK_URL` and `BARK_DEVICE_KEY`, when non-empty, override the corresponding JSON fields. A config file is optional if `BARK_URL` is supplied; if a config file exists, it must still be valid. The plugin does not load `.env` files. Environment variables must be inherited by the **Herdr server**, so exporting them later inside an individual pane does not necessarily change plugin execution. A `config.json` file is usually easier and takes effect on the next invocation.

## Managing the plugin

```sh
herdr plugin disable herdr.bark-notify
herdr plugin enable herdr.bark-notify
herdr plugin action list --plugin herdr.bark-notify
herdr plugin log list --plugin herdr.bark-notify
herdr plugin unlink herdr.bark-notify
```

Disable stops automatic hook execution through Herdr. You can also set `enabled: false` in `config.json`, which leaves the plugin actions registered. Explicit `test` commands bypass the config switches.

`unlink` unregisters a local checkout and leaves its source files intact. For a GitHub-managed installation, use `herdr plugin uninstall herdr.bark-notify`; Herdr removes its managed checkout. Herdr preserves plugin configuration and state; remove your credentials there manually if you want a complete cleanup.

Linked JavaScript and config changes apply on the next invocation. After editing `herdr-plugin.toml`, re-register with `herdr plugin link .`. To switch a linked checkout to a GitHub installation, unlink first. To update a GitHub-managed installation, reinstall it; Herdr v1 has no separate `plugin update` command. Back up custom changes in managed checkouts before reinstalling.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| `node` cannot be launched | Node 22+ must be on the server's `PATH`, including on remote hosts. A shell version manager may only initialize in interactive shells. |
| No plugin listed | Run `herdr plugin link .` from this checkout and check Herdr's version. |
| Cannot read config / missing endpoint | Get the path with `herdr plugin config-dir herdr.bark-notify`; create `config.json` there, not in the checkout. |
| Example key error | Replace `YOUR_BARK_KEY` with your actual Bark key. |
| Invalid JSON or unknown option | Use strict JSON, the documented names and types, and run `check`. Errors omit raw values to protect credentials. |
| Test succeeds, automatic notifications do not | Check plugin enable state, `enabled`, status filters, and whether Herdr actually reports `done` or `blocked`. Merely closing a process is not the trigger. Herdr may report `idle` rather than unseen `done` for a viewed/focused completion; this plugin does not reinterpret `idle`. |
| Only workspace/pane IDs are shown | The host did not provide matching labels, or no pane title was available. Set a meaningful pane title in Herdr. |
| HTTP 4xx | Check the key and endpoint; use `/push` only with `device_key`. HTTP 429 is retried. |
| HTTP 5xx / network error / timeout | Check Bark availability, DNS, firewall, and HTTPS trust. Redirects are refused; configure the final endpoint. |
| Bark rejected the notification | HTTP succeeded but Bark's JSON `code` was not `200`. Check the endpoint/key/server. |
| Notification sent but phone is quiet | Bark acceptance is not proof of iPhone delivery. Check iOS notification permissions, Focus mode, connectivity and Bark sound settings. |
| Repeated notifications | Every matching event is eligible; there is no persistent deduplication. Network retries may duplicate a push if the first delivery succeeded but its acknowledgement was lost. |
| Remote agents do not notify | Install Node, link/install the plugin, and configure Bark on the machine running that Herdr server. Local configuration is not copied to remote hosts. |

Requests retry network errors, timeouts, HTTP 429/5xx, and integer Bark response codes 429/5xx. Other rejections and invalid response JSON fail immediately. Retries wait 250 ms, then 500 ms; `Retry-After` is not interpreted. Maximum configured runtime for network attempts is roughly 30.75 seconds plus process overhead. There is no durable queue or eventual-delivery guarantee. Set `retries: 0` to avoid automatic retransmission.

Automatic hook success, ignored events and disabled notifications exit `0`; invalid input/configuration and failed sends exit `1`. Ordinary errors contain neither the endpoint/key nor raw Bark response text. Preview output intentionally contains the notification itself and may be recorded in Herdr logs. The plugin sends labels, IDs and configured content to your chosen Bark service; it does not read terminal transcripts or selected text.

## Development and validation

```sh
npm run check
npm test
npm run test:coverage
node notify.mjs preview --event fixtures/done.json
node notify.mjs preview --event fixtures/blocked.json
node notify.mjs --help
```

Tests use local HTTP servers and synthetic events, so they need neither real keys nor an iPhone and do not send notifications externally. They cover configuration, template precedence, identity/focus separation, Unicode, request payloads, HTTP and application failures, retries, deadlines, redirect refusal, CLI invocation and credential-safe errors. See [docs/VALIDATION.md](docs/VALIDATION.md) for actual verification results and limits.

```text
herdr-plugin.toml       Host registration, event hook, actions
notify.mjs             CLI and event entrypoint

```

The optional real-host smoke test requires Python 3 and Herdr on macOS/Linux:

```sh
python3 scripts/verify_herdr.py
```

It creates an isolated temporary config/state directory and headless test server, exercises actions and background agent transitions, then removes its own test server and files. It does not register the plugin in your normal Herdr profile.

## Sources

The implementation was checked against the installed Herdr 0.9.0 schema (`herdr api schema --json`), [Herdr plugin documentation](https://herdr.dev/docs/plugins/), [Herdr socket API](https://herdr.dev/docs/socket-api/), and [Bark's HTTP API documentation](https://github.com/Finb/Bark/blob/master/docs/en-us/tutorial.md). The [Telegram notification example](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr-plugin-examples/tree/main/agent-telegram-notify) informed the integration approach; this repository implements its own Bark configuration and delivery logic.
